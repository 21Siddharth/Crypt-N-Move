# Crypt-N-Move

to run the client side, 
└─$ npm install concurrently --save-dev

and run the following command
└─$ npm start-dev              

basically in package json , i have added the a script as npm start-dev which runs the react router and node server simultaneously

the node runs of 3001
and react by default on 3000

rest  i have altered the sender and reciever page 
but in sender page , the uploaded file is not being detected (so Ankit ,focus on that).
